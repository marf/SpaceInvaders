# SpaceInvaders
This game was written in C++ using the Allegro library and it requires it in order to work.
The source code was created using a UNIX machine, in fact there is also a Makefile to built the game using the UNIX terminal.
In the doc folder you can find a full documentation of the entire source code of the game. I used doxygen to do it.
