# SpaceInvaders
This game was writte in C++ using the Allegro library and it requires it in order to work.
The game was written using a UNIX machine, in fact there is alto the Makefile to built it from source code using the UNIX terminal.
In the doc folder you can find a full documentation of the entire source code of the game. I used doxygen to do it
